// Word Blanks
// We will now use our knowledge of strings to build a "Mad Libs" style word game we're calling "Word Blanks". You will create an (optionally humorous) "Fill in the Blanks" style sentence.

// In a "Mad Libs" game, you are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. 
// You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.
